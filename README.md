## General info

The Redux Fundamentals tutorial teaches "how Redux works, from the bottom up", by showing how to write Redux code by hand and why standard usage patterns exist. It then shows how Redux Toolkit simplifies those Redux usage patterns.

Since Redux Toolkit is an abstraction layer that wraps around the Redux core, it's helpful to know what RTK's APIs are actually doing for you under the hood. If you want to understand how Redux really works and why RTK is the recommended approach, read the Redux Fundamentals tutorial.
